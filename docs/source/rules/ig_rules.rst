Metagaming
**********
Metagaming is a rule that is enforced to prevent using OOC information IC and vice vera. Any use of information gained both IC and OOC must stay that way and must not be used to adapt your roleplay to prevent an event from happening due to the knowledge gained from the information you have recieved. Doing so will result in a punishment or ban depending on the severity.

   | **Example 1:**
   | Dylan's friend Andy is kidnapped ICly and Andy then contacts Dylan via Discord to let him know the location he is being held, Dylan then goes to the location and attempts to free Andy. This is Metagaming - Andy should find a way to contact Dylan in-game and deal with the situation IC. Both players would be punished in this scenario.
   
   | **Example 2:**
   | Dylan is browsing the forums and sees that a faction has posted some screenshots of their secret base, he then proceeds to go there in-game and attempts to raid it based on his knowledge from the screenshots. This is Metagaming - Dylan would have no knowledge of a secret base being hidden had he not gained the knowledge from the forums. Dylan would be punished in this scenario.
   
   | **Example 3:**
   | Dylan is PMing a player and asks how much money they have in their bank, the player responds telling him how much money he currently has in his bank. Dylan then targets the player and attempts to rob them based on this knowledge. This is Metagaming - Dylan would have no knowledge ICly about how much money the player has in his bank had he not asked via PMs. Dylan would be punished in this scenario.
