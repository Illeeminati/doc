.. note::
  The following rules should be followed when playing on the placeholder server.

**************************
Roleplay Now, Report Later
**************************
.. note::
  Please remember an Administrators decision is final. 

When conducting roleplay of any type if you notice that someone has broke a rule please conclude the roleplay first, do not attempt to stall and wait for an administrator to come to rectify the situation as this puts a pause on any current roleplay. Instead make a report after the situation has concluded and explain what happened during the roleplay and what rules were broken and the administrator can make a final decision.

Metagaming (MG)
***************
Metagaming is a rule that is enforced to prevent using OOC information IC and vice vera. Any use of information gained both IC and OOC must stay that way and must not be used to adapt your roleplay to prevent an event from happening due to the knowledge gained from the information you have recieved. Doing so will result in a punishment or ban depending on the severity.

   | **Example 1:**
   | Dylan's friend Andy is kidnapped Andy then contacts Dylan via Discord to let him know the location he is being held, Dylan then goes to the location and attempts to free Andy. This is Metagaming - Andy should find a way to contact Dylan in-game and deal with the situation IC. Both players would be punished in this scenario.
   
   | **Example 2:**
   | Dylan is browsing the forums and sees that a faction has posted some screenshots of their secret base, he then proceeds to go there in-game and attempts to raid it based on his knowledge from the screenshots. This is Metagaming - Dylan would have no knowledge of a secret base being hidden had he not gained the knowledge from the forums. Dylan would be punished in this scenario.
   
   | **Example 3:**
   | Dylan is PMing a player and asks how much money they have in their bank, the player responds telling him how much money he currently has in his bank. Dylan then targets the player and attempts to rob them based on this knowledge. This is Metagaming - Dylan would have no knowledge ICly about how much money the player has in his bank had he not asked via PMs. Dylan would be punished in this scenario.

Dylan would be punished in this scenario.
   
   | **Example 3:**
   | Dylan is in his vehicle and travelling at 100 MPH, Dylan then crashes into the side of a bulding at full speed. Dylan then proceeds to drive off like nothing happened. This is Powergaming - Dylan's actions would be considered entrely unrealistic and the situation should be roleplayed by Dylan. Dylan should roleplay his injuries as a smash at 100 MPH will definitely leave some form of injuries or may even lead to death. Dylan would be punished in this scenario.
