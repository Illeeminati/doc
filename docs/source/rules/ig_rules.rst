**********
Metagaming
**********
Metagaming is a rule that is enforced to prevent using OOC information IC and vice vera. Any use of information gained both IC and OOC must stay that way and must not be used to adapt your roleplay to prevent an event from happening due to the knowledge gained from the information you have recieved. Doing so will result in a punishment or ban depending on the severity.

   | **Example 1:**
   | Dylan's friend Andy is kidnapped Andy then contacts Dylan via Discord to let him know the location he is being held, Dylan then goes to the location and attempts to free Andy. This is Metagaming - Andy should find a way to contact Dylan in-game and deal with the situation IC. Both players would be punished in this scenario.
   
   | **Example 2:**
   | Dylan is browsing the forums and sees that a faction has posted some screenshots of their secret base, he then proceeds to go there in-game and attempts to raid it based on his knowledge from the screenshots. This is Metagaming - Dylan would have no knowledge of a secret base being hidden had he not gained the knowledge from the forums. Dylan would be punished in this scenario.
   
   | **Example 3:**
   | Dylan is PMing a player and asks how much money they have in their bank, the player responds telling him how much money he currently has in his bank. Dylan then targets the player and attempts to rob them based on this knowledge. This is Metagaming - Dylan would have no knowledge ICly about how much money the player has in his bank had he not asked via PMs. Dylan would be punished in this scenario.

************
Powergaming
************
Powergaming is a rule that is enforced to prevent unrealistic actions being preformed in-game. This means attempting to do things such as lifting a car with your bare hands or forcing roleplay on another player without allowing them ample roleplaying opportunity. All actions you preform must be realistic and must fit with your character. This includes showing fear if you are robbed, roleplaying injuries appropriately etc. Failing to do so will result in punishment or a ban depending on severity.

   | **Example 1:**
   | Dylan does a /me line saying that he picks up a car and lifts it above his head and throws it at Andy. This is Powergaming - This action is completely unrealistic and could not be done by a regular human being. Dylan would be punsished in this scenario.
   
   | **Example 2:**
   | Dylan is robbing Andy, Dylan then searches Andy's body and does a /do line stating that Andy would not be able to resist this action - Andy is then forced to show his items. This is Powergaming - Dylan should allow Andy aple roleplaying opportunity without forcing Andy into an action, Andy is entitled to respond to the initial /do line with his own response. Dylan would be punished in this scenario.
   
   | **Example 3:**
   | Dylan is in his vehicle and travelling at 100 MPH, Dylan then crashes into the side of a bulding at full speed. Dylan then proceeds to drive off like nothing happened. This is Powergaming - Dylan's actions would be considered entrely unrealistic and the situation should be roleplayed by Dylan. Dylan should roleplay his injuries as a smash at 100 MPH will definitely leave some form of injuries or may even lead to death. Dylan would be punished in this scenario.
   
**************
Ninja-Jacking
**************
Ninja-Jacking is a rule that is enforced to prevent players randomly approaching occupied vehicles and stealing them without any attempt to roleplay. Car-jacking must be appropriately roleplayed just like any other action. Failing to do so will result in punishment.

   | **Example:**
   | Dylan is running down the road near Pizza Stacks, he sees a car that looks really fast so he approaches the vehicle and car-jacks the occupant without any roleplay. This is Ninja-Jacking - Dylan should roleplay the entirety of the car-jacking allowing ample roleplaying opportunity to the occupant. Dylan would be punished in this scenario.
